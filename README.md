Begin refactoring the ‘AddCustomer’ method in the CustomerService class in order to make the class easier to maintain. During the refactoring process you should consider the SOLID principles, how readable the code is and where unit tests might be appropriate.

Use whatever test frameworks you wish.

We are aware that the validation logic isn't perfect but we do not expect you to fix that or make it more comprehensive.

You can change anything (method signatures, constructors etc.) apart from making the CustomerDataAccess class and it methods non static.

Feel free to use the internet to look up anything you need.
